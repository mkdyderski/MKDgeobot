History of changes
=======
*version 0.2*
The package was developed and pushed into GitHub for its very first time;)

*version 0.3*
I made function `tabelka()` independent on column-order and row-order. Now the colnames of datasets imported from JUICE (with species names like 'Acer.negundo_4') are transformed into normal latin names (in this case into 'Acer negundo'). It allows the funtion to use ecological variables dataset to different data.
I also improved this function by using two variants: for vegetation analysis (deflaut) and floristic analysis (more variables). Documentation for this function was improved.
